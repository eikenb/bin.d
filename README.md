~/bin
-----

Various scripts from my ~/bin directory. I've organized the ones I want in
github into ~/bin/bin.d/ that I then just add all contained directories to my
path.

- audio - play/convert/tag whatever
- files - general/pipe file related things
- mail  - mutt and spam filter related
- net   - wifi connecting and pinging
- terminal - various handy terminal scripts
